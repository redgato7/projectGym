# Setup

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/ | At least have 8.2.1 version or newer.

I suggest you to install also cmder: https://cmder.net/

Go to directory client by unix commands in cmder and run commands to install app.

# Client Terminal A:

cd client

npm install

npm start

# Server Terminal B:

cd server

npm install

npm start

# Errors

If you have error "please install sqlite3 package manually" you gotta do:

npm install sqlite3 --save

npm install sequelize --save

And then:

npm start
